<h1>RZ Tech & Web - Project Varrock (in progress)</h1>
<h2><em>Ticketing System</em></h2>
<p>This page will always showcase the current project we are working on.</p>
<p>The main point of this update is to release our first piece of employee software to aid with business operations.<br>
    The first product we are creating is a tracking system which keeps track of tickets that customers open with us.<br>
    The main goal is to have an interface that both employees and customers can use to stay up-to-date on the work<br>
    that we are doing for a particular customer on an issue.
</p>
<p>
    Completing this project will inevitably yield a lot of modular software infrastructure that can be used later on<br>
    to create future applications with ease, as much of our technical framework will either be established or refined<br>
    in the process of creating our first piece of complete software. We are placing heavy emphasis on making it easy to<br>
    follow RESTful frameworks for projects going forward, as well as establishing a good consistent framework for<br>
    development processes. This update will likely contain a lot of backend work to the <a href="//https://github.com/kanetempleton/JBend">JBend</a> Engine,<br>
    which may not be explicitly stated as feature updates for our software, but I will include the engine changes in the change log.
